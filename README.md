# Minecraft Map Converter
An old project from 2019 I rediscovered, It was an attempt to show how images were distorted when you converted then into a mincraft map colour pallete.

However, it was one my first big projects and it really shows. It's completely uncommented, extremely obtuse, and missing many of the techniques I use today.
